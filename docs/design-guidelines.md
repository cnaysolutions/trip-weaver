Emotional Thesis
Feels like a private travel desk in a quiet boutique hotel—measured, elegant, and deeply competent.
Calm replaces urgency. Kindness replaces efficiency theater.
This product is not fast.
It is unrushed.

Emotional Foundations (from Lovable Philosophy)
Guiding beliefs drawn from design-tips.md:
	• Start with feeling before features.
	• Design scenes, not screens.
	• Assume users are thoughtful, not careless.
	• Build in forgiveness and reversibility.
	• Optimize for emotional residue, not speed.
TripWeave should leave users feeling:
	• Reassured
	• Capable
	• Unpressured
	• Quietly confident

Hierarchy

	• Body
		○ Line-height ≥ 1.5×
		○ Comfortable reading rhythm

Rules:
	• Never compress line-height.

Emotional Audit Checklist
Before shipping any screen, ask:

	• Can the user change their mind safely?
	• Would this feel supportive when tired?
If any answer is “no,” redesign.
